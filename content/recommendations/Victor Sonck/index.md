summary: "**R&D Data Scientist AI for Recycling at [VITO](https://www.vito.be/)**
<br /><br />
**‟** Rizwan has been a fun and talented colleague, always positive and constructive. When debugging Python bugs together it was always a fun experience. We tended to meet when the work to be done was especially difficult or hard to diagnose, but his technical skills allow him to quickly remedy any issue. I highly recommend Rizwan as a colleague and friend! **”**"
