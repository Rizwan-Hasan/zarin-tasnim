summary: "**Product Manager at [Ottopia](https://ottopia.tech/)**
<br /><br />
**‟** I've worked with Rizwan as a product manager, managing the product Rizwan was developing. Rizwan is a bright engineer, with a great can-do attitude that's always positive and always up for the challenge. He has demonstrated coding and problem-solving capabilities, as well as being open to new challenges and working with tools he has little to no experience with, all with great success. His communication style is forward and easy to work with and his attitude is very positive! **”**"
