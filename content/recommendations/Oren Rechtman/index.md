summary: "**VP Engineering at [ClearML](https://clear.ml/) [(Allegro.AI)](https://allegro.ai/)**
<br /><br />
**‟** I the last year and a half, Rizwan has participated in our software development efforts. He began with almost no experience at all, but managed to successfully take part in solving issues and in developing tools for ClearML. During his time with us, he showed dedication and effort to learn and improve, and willingness to adapt to new challenges. I believe Rizwan has the potential to continue progressing and improving in his future roles, and can be an asset to any company. **”**"
