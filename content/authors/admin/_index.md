I am a **Recent Psychology Graduate** with a keen interest in understanding the complexities of human behavior and thought processes. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from [National University (Chittagong College)](https://ctgcollege.gov.bd/), where I built a strong foundation in psychological theories. My academic journey, combined with hands-on experience as a **Trainee Psychologist** at [Chattogram Ma O Shishu Hospital](https://www.cmoshbd.org/) in **Child Development Center**, has enriched my understanding of mental health dynamics and counseling.

Besides that, I have also completed **Basic Counseling** training at [Bondhu](https://www.bondhu-bd.com/), which enhanced my skills in empathetic listening, effective communication, and applying psychological insights.
